# Welcome to Wetland Vulnerability Analysis Tool

Development of wetlands assessment methodology is one of the outputs of a consultancy  project on Wetlands Vulnerability Analysis using GIS Analysis Tools. The project is being  implemented as part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security **[(GMES)](https://gmes.rcmrd.org/)** &   **Africa Programme**, specifically, under the component awarded to the Regional Center for   Mapping of Resources for Development **[(RCMRD)](https://rcmrd.org/)** and partners. 

# Purpose

The aim of Wetlands Vulnerability Analysis is to  enhance the Wetlands Monitoring and assessment using geoinformation processing tools and techniques.

## Targeted Region

The analysis is targeting 10 eastern Africa countries, namely: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda.

## Objectives

The main objective is to develop a methodology and tools for the analysis of wetlands.  Specific objectives:

 - To review current wetlands vulnerability assessment methods
 - To develop a methodology based on EO data and Spatial/GIS tools using scientific   knowledge as well as experience from the Eastern Africa region.

A multi-criteria aggregation approach (MCA) of individually weighted indicator data was used to generate Wetland Vulnerability index:

```math
wvi=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_iv_i.
```

> Where $`wvi`$ is wetland vulnerability Index, $`w_i`$ is the weight of the indicator and $`v_i`$ is the  Indicator.
